"""
*** This is the main module of the WasteAndMaterialFootprint tool ***

* To use the defaults, just run the whole script (but this will only work if you have the same format of project and database names)
* The terms of the waste search query can be edited config/queries_waste.py
* The list of materials can be edited in config/list_materials.txt
* The names of the projects and databases can be edited in config/user_settings.py

DEFAULTS:

EI database is of form 'cutoff38' or 'con39'
* versions = ["35", "38", "39", "391]
* models = ["cutoff", 'con', 'apos']

The script will copy the project "default"+<db_name> to project "WasteAndMaterialFootprint_"+<db_name>
* 'project_base': "default_"+<dbase>,
* 'project_wasteandmaterial': "WasteAndMaterialFootprint_"+<dbase>,
