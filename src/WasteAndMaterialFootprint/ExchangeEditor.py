"""
ExchangeEditor():
For every activity identified by WasteAndMaterialSearch(), this function appends the pertinent exchange 
from the db_wasteandmaterial. This is the most time-consuming function, taking around 10 minutes per database.

def ExchangeEditor(project_wasteandmaterial, db_name, db_wasteandmaterial_name):
    """
    Modify the specified project's database to append relevant exchanges
    from the db_wasteandmaterial for every activity identified by WasteAndMaterialSearch().

    For each exchange found, this function identifies the process, and then adds
    a new exchange to that process in the `db_wasteandmaterial`. The new exchange
    replicates the same amount and unit as the original technosphere waste and material exchange.

    Parameters:
    - project_wasteandmaterial (str): Name of the Brightway2 project to be modified.
    - db_name (str): Name of the database within the project where activities and exchanges are stored.
    - db_wasteandmaterial_name (str): Name of the database containing waste and material exchange details.

    Returns:
    None

    Side Effects:
    - Modifies the given Brightway2 project by appending exchanges.
    - Writes log entries with statistics on added exchanges to a log file.

    Notes:
    The function reads files produced by both SearchWaste() and SearchMaterial()
    to determine which exchanges need to be added.

    This function is computationally intensive and might take approximately 30-60 minutes per database, depending on the number of exchanges to edit.
