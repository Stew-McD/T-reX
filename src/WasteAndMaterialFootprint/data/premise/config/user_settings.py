user_settings Module
====================

Configure Project and Database Settings for WasteAndMaterialFootprint tool.

This script is used to configure the project and database settings, as well as set up the essential paths for the data, config, and result directories.

The script allows for two modes of operation:
    1. Single Mode (`single` is True): Set the project and database names to a single specified value.
    2. Multiple projects/databases mode (`single` is False): Facilitates batch processing of multiple projects and databases.

Additionally, the script allows for the use of multiprocessing (`use_multiprocessing` is True). 

Premise can also be used to make future databases (`use_premise` is True).
