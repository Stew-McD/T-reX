SearchMaterial Module
=====================

This script loads data from '<db name>_exploded.pickle', runs search queries, 
and produces a CSV to store the results and a log entry. The search queries are 
formatted as dictionaries with fields NAME, CODE, and search terms keywords_AND, 
keywords_OR, and keywords_NOT. These queries are defined in `config/queries_waste.py`.
