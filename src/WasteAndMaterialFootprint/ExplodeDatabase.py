ExplodeDatabase Module
======================

This module is responsible for exploding a Brightway2 database into a single-level list of all exchanges.
It utilizes the wurst package to unpack the database, explode it to a list of all exchanges, and save this data 
in a DataFrame as a .pickle binary file.
