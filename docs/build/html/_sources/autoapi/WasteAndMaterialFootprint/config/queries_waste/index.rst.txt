   queries_waste Module
   ====================

   This module defines the search parameters for each waste and material flow category. It is used in conjunction with `SearchWaste.py` and requires a .pickle file generated by `ExplodeDatabase.py`.

   The queries are set up for different waste flow categories like digestion, composting, incineration, recycling, and landfill, among others. Each query is a dictionary containing search terms for the respective category.

   The module creates two sets of queries:
   1. `queries_kg` for waste flows measured in kilograms.
   2. `queries_m3` for waste flows measured in cubic meters.

   These queries are combined into the `queries_waste` list, which is then used by `SearchWaste.py` for filtering and extracting relevant data from the database.
