   ExchangeEditor Module
   =====================

   This module is responsible for editing exchanges with wurst and Brightway2.
   It appends relevant exchanges from the `db_wmf` (database containing waste and material exchange details)
   to activities identified by `WasteAndMaterialSearch()` in the specified project's database (`db_name`).
   Each appended exchange replicates the same amount and unit as the original technosphere waste and material exchange.
