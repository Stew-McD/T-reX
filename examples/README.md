# T-reX examples

* An example of the terminal output from the application of T-reX is presented as [a pdf](T-reX_example_terminal_output.pdf) and [a text file](T-reX_example_terminal_output.txt).

* The full virtual environment used to generate the example is listed in [T-reX_virtual_environment_pip-freeze.txt](T-reX_virtual_environment_pip-freeze.txt). This file can be used to recreate the virtual environment by running `pip install -r T-reX_virtual_environment_pip-freeze.txt` in a fresh python venv.

* An example of the intermediate data produced by T-reX is available in the [T-reX_example-data](T-reX_example-data) directory (search results, logs, etc.).

* The main product of the application of T-reX is the set of manipulated databases. These are not included in the repository due to licensing restrictions. These can be recreated by running T-reX on your own machine using the instructions provided in the documentation.
